First open create_cookies.py and sign in to your account, so that the cookies are dropped inside a json file. Than you can start UdemyPicker.py as long as your cookies are valid and it will use the links provided (https://gist.github.com/temminks/bc90582aadd7d466fef67aed524d886d) to double check if the courses are free and then will sign you up for all courses.
